## Planned projects for the future 
### You're not the hero
- it's a placeholder name for a game that I wanna make 
- it's an RPG game with many story paths and lots of freedom, many things to develop, etc
- the game will be about the player realizing that they're not the hero, and others seeing them as a villain. they would go around reading notes, etc making the villain seem like the hero
