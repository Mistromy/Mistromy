## üîç Current Projects:
### Courier Simulator
- It's a low-poly game made in unity where the goal is to deliver parcels to people's houses. Earn points to spend on upgrades, new vehicles etc.
- It's still in early development but its already (kinda) playable.

### Ayumr
- Pretty much a rip off of Chiru-San's discord bot Ayumi 
- Has basic functionality including 
 - Levels & role assigning (currently broken)
 - Many commands including 
  - utility commands 
  - joke commands 
 -and a website with a list of all the features

### Illusions Of Glory
- it's a placeholder name for a game that I wanna make 
- it's an RPG game with many story paths and lots of freedom, many things to develop, etc
- the game will be about the player realizing that they're not the hero, and others seeing them as a villain. they would go around reading notes, etc making the villain seem like the hero
